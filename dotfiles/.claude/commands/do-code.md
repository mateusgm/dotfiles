1. Understand the big picture of what we're trying to do from $ARGUMENTS/spec.md
2. Open $ARGUMENTS/todo.md and $ARGUMENTS/plan.md to understand the plan and identify incompleted tasks 
3. Implement the first 3-4 incomplete tasks
   - Pull latest changes from origin/main
   - create a new branch
   - open a PR when you are done
4. Repeat with the next batch

Think carefully and only action the specific tasks I have given you, nothing less, nothing more.
Use the most concise solution that changes as little code as possible.
Commit frequently. TDD, DRY, YAGNI ruthlessly.
Dont adjust safeguards without asking my approval.
