Great, now I want you to carefully read over all of the new code you just wrote and other existing code you just modified with "fresh eyes," looking super carefully for any obvious bugs, errors, problems, issues, performance issues, vulnerabilities, code duplication etc. Use subagents.

Once you are done, spend some time fixing the issues.
