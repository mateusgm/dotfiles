I've got an idea I want to talk through with you. 

Check out the current state of the project in our working directory to understand where we're starting off, then ask me questions, one at a time, to help me refine the idea and so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step fully formed spec. 

Ideally, the questions would be multiple choice, but open-ended questions are OK, too.

Don't forget: only one question per message. Once you believe you understand what we're doing, stop and  compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification.  Include the problem description, all relevant requirements, architecture choices, data handling details, error handling strategies, and a testing plan so a developer can immediately begin implementation. save it into ./specs/$ARGUMENTS/spec.md

Here’s the idea:
